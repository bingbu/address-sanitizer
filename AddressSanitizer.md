# Introduction #

AddressSanitizer (aka ASan) is a memory error detector for C/C++.
It finds:
  * [Use after free](ExampleUseAfterFree.md) (dangling pointer dereference)
  * [Heap buffer overflow](ExampleHeapOutOfBounds.md)
  * [Stack buffer overflow](ExampleStackOutOfBounds.md)
  * [Global buffer overflow](ExampleGlobalOutOfBounds.md)
  * [Use after return](ExampleUseAfterReturn.md)
  * [Initialization order bugs](InitializationOrderFiasco.md)

This tool is very fast. The average slowdown of the instrumented program is ~2x (see PerformanceNumbers).

The tool consists of a compiler instrumentation module (currently, an LLVM pass)
and a run-time library which replaces the `malloc` function.

The tool works on x86 Linux and Mac, and ARM Android.

# Getting AddressSanitizer #

AddressSanitizer is a part of [LLVM](http://llvm.org) starting with version 3.1 and a part of [GCC](http://gcc.gnu.org) starting with version 4.8 

&lt;BR&gt;


If you prefer to build from source, see HowToBuild.


So far, AddressSanitizer has been tested only on Linux Ubuntu 12.04, 64-bit
(it can run both 64- and 32-bit programs), Mac 10.6, 10.7 and 10.8, and [Android](Android.md) 4.2+.


# Using AddressSanitizer #
In order to use AddressSanitizer you will need to compile and link your program using `clang` with the `-fsanitize=address` switch. 

&lt;BR&gt;


To get a reasonable performance add `-O1` or higher. 

&lt;BR&gt;


To get nicer stack traces in error messages add `-fno-omit-frame-pointer`. 

&lt;BR&gt;


Note: [Clang 3.1 release uses another flag syntax](http://llvm.org/releases/3.1/tools/clang/docs/AddressSanitizer.html).

```
% cat tests/use-after-free.c
#include <stdlib.h>
int main() {
  char *x = (char*)malloc(10 * sizeof(char*));
  free(x);
  return x[5];
}
% ../clang_build_Linux/Release+Asserts/bin/clang -fsanitize=address -O1 -fno-omit-frame-pointer -g   tests/use-after-free.c
```

Now, run the executable. [CallStack page](CallStack.md) describes how to obtain symbolized stack traces.

```

# Interaction with other tools #
## gdb ##
See AddressSanitizerAndDebugger


## ulimit -v ##
The `ulimit -v` command makes little sense with ASan-ified binaries
because ASan consumes 20 terabytes of virtual memory (plus a bit).

You may try more sophisticated tools to limit your memory consumption,
e.g. http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/cgroups/memory.txt

# Flags #
See the separate [Flags page](Flags.md).

# Call stack #

See the separate [CallStack page](CallStack.md).

# Incompatibility #

Sometimes an AddressSanitizer build may behave differently than the regular one. See [Incompatiblity](Incompatiblity.md) for details.

# Turning off instrumentation #
In some cases a particular function should be ignored (not instrumented) by AddressSanitizer:
  * Ignore a very hot function known to be correct to speedup the app.
  * Ignore a function that does some low-level magic (e.g. walking through the thread's stack bypassing the frame boundaries).
  * Don't report a known problem.
In either case, be **very careful**.

To ignore certain functions, one can use the **no\_sanitize\_address**
attribute supported by Clang (3.3+) and GCC (4.8+). You can define the following macro:
```
#if defined(__clang__) || defined (__GNUC__)
# define ATTRIBUTE_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS __attribute__((no_sanitize_address))
#else
# define ATTRIBUTE_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS
#endif
...
ATTRIBUTE_NO_SANITIZE_ADDRESS
void ThisFunctionWillNotBeInstrumented() {...}
```

Clang 3.1 and 3.2 supported `__attribute__((no_address_safety_analysis))` instead.

You may also ignore certain functions using a blacklist: create a file `my_ignores.txt` and pass it to AddressSanitizer
at compile time using `-fsanitize-blacklist=my_ignores.txt` (This flag is new and is only supported by Clang now):
```
# Ignore exactly this function (the names are mangled)
fun:MyFooBar
# Ignore MyFooBar(void) if it is in C++:
fun:_Z8MyFooBarv
# Ignore all function containing MyFooBar
fun:*MyFooBar*
```


# FAQ #
  * Q: Can AddressSanitizer continue running after reporting first error?
  * A: No, sorry. AddressSanitizer errors are fatal. This design choice allows the tool to be faster and simpler.

  * Q: Why didn't ASan report an obviously invalid memory access in my code?
  * A: If your error is too obvious, compiler might have already optimized it out by the time Asan gets a chance to see it.

  * Q: When I link my shared library with -fsanitize=address, it fails due to some undefined ASan symbols.
  * A: Most probably you link with -Wl,-z,defs or -Wl,--no-undefined. These flags don't work with ASan.

  * Q: My malloc stacktraces are too short?
  * A: Try to compile your code with -fno-omit-frame-pointer or set ASAN\_OPTIONS=fast\_unwind\_on\_malloc=0 (the latter would be a performance killer though).
