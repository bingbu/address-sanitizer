basictypes.h, sysinfo.cc and sysinfo.h were taken with minor modifications from Google Perftools,
http://code.google.com/p/google-perftools (BSD license).

We don't need most of that stuff, so it'll be nice to clean those files up,
retaining the license notice.

mach_override.c and mach_override.h were taken from the mach_star framework,
